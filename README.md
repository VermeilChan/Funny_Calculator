Funny Calculator

This code is like having a personal math assistant! You just tell it what numbers to crunch and which operation to use (+, -, *, /), and it does the work for you. It even speaks decimal! But be warned, if you try to trick it with an invalid operator, it will give you an error message and refuse to do your bidding. So be nice to your calculator function!
